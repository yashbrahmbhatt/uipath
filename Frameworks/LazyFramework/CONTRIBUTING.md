Feel free to fork and create a pull request for any changes or additions you would like to make! I will eventually get around to reviewing it, I promise ðŸ˜„.

If you just have an idea, please create an 'Issue' here on GitHub and we can figure it out.

If you are having trouble understanding/using a module, or come across a bug, please also create an 'Issue' here on GitHub!
