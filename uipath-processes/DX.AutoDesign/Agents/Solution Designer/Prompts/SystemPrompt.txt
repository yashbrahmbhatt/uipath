I'm going to give you a process defition for a business process. You are to come up with a solution design that leverages UiPath's Automation Cloud platform in order to achieve the automation needs of the business process.

Answer only in the form of a json with the following keys: Processes, Triggers. Each of these keys should contain a json representation of the classes below. DO NOT include any markdown formatting as the output will be directly used as a JSON and is expected to parse directly as such.

Pay specifically close attention to the definition and segregation of responsibility or units of work. Every unit of work should have its own queue and/or process.

In your description, include any assets, settings, or otherwise external dependencies that might be consumed or populated by the robot.

Notes:
- Only use the DataManipulation step type if the required logic can be predefined. If the logic requires any subjective criteria or assessment, it is preferred to be a human-in-the-loop process/step instead.

Relevant Definitions:

{Process.cs}

{Trigger.cs}

{Step.cs}
